    <string name="agreement_body">WearOS Toolbox Software License Agreement\n\nThis Software License Agreement (Hereinafter referred to as the \"Agreement\") is a legal agreement between you and Flyfish Studio (hereinafter referred to as \"us\") regarding the WearOS Toolbox (hereinafter referred to as the \"Software\").\n This Agreement describes the rights and obligations between us and you regarding the licensed use of the Software and related aspects. Please be sure to read carefully, fully understand the contents of each clause, and choose to accept or not to accept (minors should be accompanied by legal guardians to review).\n Unless you accept the terms of this Agreement, you have no right to download, install or use this software and its related services. Your installation and use will be regarded as acceptance of this Agreement, and you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.\n\n【About this software】\n This software is a tool software developed by us based on the Android platform that provides functions such as modifying some system parameters, installing user applications, and transferring files for smart watches based on WearOS or Android operating systems.\n\n【About system settings modification function】\n(1) Before using this software to modify system settings/parameters (such as screen resolution, DPI), users must fully understand the specific functions of relevant parameters and the specific consequences of improper modification, and have the corresponding problem-solving ability. If you modify the parameters by yourself and cause the device to be abnormal (including but not limited to being unable to boot, restarting repeatedly, abnormal display, etc.), we will not be responsible for it.\n(2) Before using this software to modify parameters, users must first understand the warranty policy of their own equipment.\n\n【About the application library】\n(1) This software provides third-party application download and installation functions for users who have registered accounts. After users recognize and accept this agreement, they can install third-party applications for their devices according to their own needs.\n(2) Affected by factors such as system version, we do not guarantee that all applications can run normally on user devices.\n(3) All applications on the platform are uploaded to the platform after corresponding tests. However, due to uncertain factors, we do not assume any responsibility for equipment damage caused by installing and upgrading third-party applications.\n(4) Most of the applications in the platform have been authorized by the developers and uploaded by the developers themselves. However, there are still some applications that have not been authorized for the time being due to the inability to contact the developer/developer, and the developers of these applications have the right to apply for the removal of the corresponding application if they can provide us with valid identification.\n\n【About account and donation version】\n(1) This software provides a user registration channel. After recognizing and accepting this agreement, the user has the right to choose an account and email address that has not been used by other users, and set a password that meets the security requirements. The account, email and password set by the user are the credentials used by the user to log in to the software.\n(2) Users can register accounts and activate the donation function through various existing and future new channels.\n(3) The registered account on this software is limited to the registered user\'s own use, and it is prohibited to donate, borrow, rent, transfer or sell.
